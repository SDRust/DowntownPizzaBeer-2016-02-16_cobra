## San Diego Rust Meetup - February 16th, 2016 ##

Tonight's exercise was to parse the output of https://en.wikipedia.org, and
count how many HTML `<div>` tags are included on that page.

The Meetup group was split in to two teams, and each team was assigned a Rust
HTTP library to demo and use in their final project code.

After some time spent hacking, this repo is the result of "Team Cobra", which
was assigned the **hyper** HTTP library.

Enjoy!
